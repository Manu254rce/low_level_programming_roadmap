#!/bin/bash

# This shell script generates file listings for a
# Nasm x86 program and store the output in a file

# The script shows listings for:
#   - basic listing
#   - listings with expanded macros
#   - listings with byte counts in decimal instead of hex
#   - preprocessed input (code after preprocessor has run and shows the result after all macros and includes are processed)
#   - verbose listing
